Now, the Financial Times reports, its digital wallet Apple Pay could be the next battleground for antitrust probes.What Happened: Apple Pay&#39;s growth has attracted little attention in the U.S. and only a passing mention by Congress&#39; antitrust subcommittee in October, as per FT. The antitrust issues in Apple Pay revolve around how it blocks its rivals from using the near-field communication technology (NFC) on its devices.The European Commission opened a formal antitrust probe in Apple Pay in June and competition regulators in the Netherlands started their own investigation this month. FT reports that Apple&#39;s approach to payments was raising competition issues in Australia.Law firm Clifford Chance&#39;s partner, Thomas Vinje, said that EU regulators have Apple Pay on their agenda. He added that there is political momentum behind pursuing antitrust cases against Apple.&quot;Apple only giving the consumer one option in how to use that technology to pay for services is what will get the attention of regulators,&quot; said Jonathan Osborne, a former federal prosecutor in Florida.FT reports that Apple spokeswoman Jennifer Bailey told the European Commission in December that the iPhone maker wants to keep the user data private and does not store the original bank card or credit card number. &quot;When you buy something using Apple Pay, Apple doesn&#39;t know what you bought, or where you bought it,&quot; she said.Another antitrust issue is that Apple asks app developers in an online guide to making Apple Pay the default option when possible.Why It Matters: Apple controlling its full ecosystem has been a sticking point with third-party developers. This week, Facebook, Inc (NASDAQ: FB) took potshots at Apple in full-page ads. Apple, in response, said the new policies will only require the social media giant to give its users a choice.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) Alipay and WeChat Pay have shown the capabilities of how contactless payments app can grow into microloans, wealth management, insurance, and paying bills.FT reports that it is unclear that Apple has such ambitions. Still, Tim Cook recently told investors that Apple Pay is doing &quot;exceptionally well&quot; and the company is bullish about what it can do in the payments space. Price Action: AAPL shares closed 0.70% higher at $128.70 on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Berkshire&#39;s Charlie Munger Warns Against Market Frenzy, Expects Lower Returns In Next Decade  * Google Kills Its Google Home Max Smart Speaker Line(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

But in a sense, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle need the venture to be a success more than the music streaming giant does.The Stockholm-based company has gone on a recent podcast bender, spending more than $1 billion to acquire production houses and technology firms and sign exclusive agreements with figures such as the Obamas and comedian Joe Rogan. These efforts have helped double its stock price this year.The push into podcasts is astute because it should boost Spotify’s profitability and ability to attract new users. The earnings potential of the company’s core music business is held back by the fixed percentage of revenue it pays the recording industry in the form of royalties. Podcasts, on the other hand, have economies of scale. There’s a one-off production cost, so the profit margin increases as the audience grows. Podcast listeners also skew younger and college-educated, making them appealing to advertisers. Cha-ching. And just as Netflix Inc. found that exclusive video programming can accelerate subscriptions, Spotify is gambling that podcasts can do the same. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek told investors in October that almost one in five podcasts on Spotify was an original exclusive.Meanwhile, exclusive music content is hard to come by. Although streaming has helped make the recording industry financially viable again, musicians still make the lion’s share of their income from touring. They therefore want their tunes to reach the greatest possible audience to foster demand for their live shows. It’s simply not in their interest to restrict their music to just one platform, be it Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music or YouTube Music.Such exclusives that exist are usually temporary: The accompanying album to Mariah Carey’s “Magical Christmas Special” on Apple TV+ was restricted to Apple Music for only a week before becoming available elsewhere. That may have encouraged some additional subscriptions, but probably not many. Even Beyonce and Jay-Z, part-owners of the streaming service Tidal, only made their 2018 album “Everything is Love” exclusive to that platform for a few days.So far there is little detail about Meghan and Harry’s “multi-year” agreement with Spotify, beyond that it will encompass several different series starting with a Christmas special. The financial value is unclear, though it will probably be far less than Rogan’s $100 million arrangement.What we do know is this show will be the first serious test of the couple’s creative chops. Their royal status secured them the contracts — they also signed a production deal with Netflix in September — but now is when the rubber really hits the road.Although I’m sure Spotify CEO Ek wants their productions to be compelling, the deal doesn’t represent a significant risk for him. The Sussexes will bring an audience with them, and therefore subscribers, irrespective of how good the shows turn out to be. The Swedish firm is betting it has enough other appealing content that any new listeners will stick around. One show can drive a sign-up, but it alone is unlikely to retain it.Much of the risk instead falls on the Sussexes and their production company Archewell. Spotify could readily ditch them if the data show they’re no longer attracting listeners. There is evidence that it’s better to invest in fewer, higher quality programs, which may explain why the morass of undifferentiated interview-style shows are often slowly phased out — it’s what’s called the great “podfade.” If the Sussexes produce dross, their reinvention as media impresarios will peter out too.The couple’s main clout will be the strength of their contact book and ability to rope in other prominent figures. If they can parlay that into good listening, then they’ll benefit just as much as Spotify.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe&#39;s technology, media and communications industries.

It comes a day after 10 Republican state attorneys general led by Texas sued the company for anticompetitive practices, and follows an October complaint by the Justice Department.“Never before have so many states and the federal government come together to challenge a company with such power,” Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said in a statement Thursday. “Google has more data on consumers, and more variety of information, than perhaps any entity in history.”The lawsuit, filed by 38 attorneys general, accuses Google of illegally monopolizing internet search and search advertising through a series of anticompetitive contracts and conduct, hurting consumers and advertisers in the process. The case also takes aim at deals to place Google on connected devices, homes and cars, which the attorneys general cast as an effort to protect competition in a new technological frontier. Google countered in a blog post that it has improved search results in ways that many world regulators had previously deemed pro-competitive.“This lawsuit seeks to redesign search in ways that would deprive Americans of helpful information and hurt businesses’ ability to connect directly with customers,” said Google’s director of economic policy Adam Cohen. “We look forward to making that case in court.”The Justice Department and 11 Republican state attorneys general sued Google on Oct. 20 in the most significant monopolization case in more than two decades. That case focuses on Google’s agreements with Apple Inc. and other partners to provide Google search as a default to users.The Texas-led case focuses on Google’s control over the technology that delivers display ads across the web. It alleges that Google reached an illegal deal with Facebook Inc. to persuade the social media giant to back off from competing in this market.Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said during a virtual press conference that the new case goes beyond the Justice Department’s complaint. Unlike that suit, the states are targeting Google’s conduct in specialized search services, such as local queries, saying the company made it harder for users to access information from rival providers. Weiser said that the states will move to consolidate the suit with the federal case.“Probably the most comparable case is 20 years ago, the Microsoft case,” Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson told reporters during the press conference. “We’re in a new time, a new era.”The antitrust case against Microsoft Corp., which began in 1998 and focused on deals to distribute its software and operating systems, helped set the terms for competition in the emerging internet industry.Antitrust actions against large technology platforms have escalated dramatically in the final weeks of the year. The Federal Trade Commission and a group of more than 45 states led by New York filed a pair of lawsuits recently against Facebook alleging the social-media giant thwarted competition to protect its monopoly. The suits sought court orders to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.Critics have accused Google of using its dominance of the online search market to steal other companies’ content for its own results and starve competitors of vital traffic. They also claim it has made acquisitions in online ads and video that reduced competition, and locked up key distribution channels on browsers and mobile operating systems.Google argues that its search engine is popular and free, that rankings are driven by consumer needs and that prior deals passed regulatory scrutiny.Google has said that the U.S.-led search case is “deeply flawed” and called Wednesday’s filing “meritless” and “inaccurate.” The company argues that platforms’ agreements for prime placement before consumers are common in many markets and don’t prevent users from switching to competitors.Google also says it faces stiff competition from companies including Amazon.com Inc. for the most profitable searches, which show consumer intent to purchase goods and command greater advertiser dollars.Like the Justice Department complaint against Google, the new state case targets the distribution deals Google reached with Apple and mobile carriers that the states say illegally cut off competition from other search providers. Those agreements have made Google the de facto search engine on nearly all mobile devices in the U.S., the states said.The states also accuse Google of illegally monopolizing search by cutting off traffic to specialized search providers that focus on a particular commercial segments like travel, local businesses and shopping. Those search services rely on Google to get customers and represent a potential threat to Google’s dominance, particularly because their niche offerings are attractive to advertisers, the states said.Instead of competing fairly against those companies, Google used its gatekeeper role to exclude them, according to the complaint. Google limits the kind of ads those search providers can buy to attract customers. It also blocks certain companies from appearing in Google’s OneBox feature that typically provides a map and listings, the states said.“Google’s decision to degrade access to such opportunities for specialized vertical providers lacks any legitimate business justification and is for the purpose and effect of excluding rivals,” they said.Yelp, which has long complained about Google conduct, cheered the states’ lawsuit.“For nearly a decade, Yelp’s small public policy team has openly advocated for heightened antitrust scrutiny of Google’s behavior, so it is gratifying to see Google finally brought to justice for this specific conduct,” said Luther Lowe, a Yelp public policy executive.(Adds lawsuit filed in Washington federal court in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-sued-states-over-abuse-175542171.html","author_name":"Ben Brody and David McLaughlin","provider_publish_time":1608249270,"provider_name":"Bloomberg","hosted":true,"tickers":["AAPL"],"thumbnail":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/e0362a2f2480cf3185e4c0c19e5dd656","featured":false,"timeZoneShortName":"EST","timeZoneFullName":"America/New_York","gmtOffSetMilliseconds":-18000000,"imageSet":{}},{"rank":17,"id":"3d372abc-68aa-3269-9f2d-5ec1fcf95385","tag":"news","title":"Europe Clears Google-Fitbit Deal.
